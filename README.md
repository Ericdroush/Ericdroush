Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm trying to learn github to be more proficient at my job, I've dabbled in coding for a long time, but mostly on individual projects.   

I've used Fortran, C++, VBA, Python, and Matlab to some degree over time.   I love coming up with great ways to use code to enhance my personal life.  

Here's a few projects I've worked on:
- Quickbooks alternative for my wife's real estate business
- AdventofCode.com <-- I can't get enough of this
- Tax sale property data webscraper
- Foreclosure property data webscraper
- Sudoko puzzle solver
